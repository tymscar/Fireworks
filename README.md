I wanted to make fireworks in Unity without using the particle system. I know it is not as efficient this way but it was a really good programming exercise and it was very fun to make.
P.S.: The game runs way above 300 FPS on a Asus R9 280x. The gif at the start of the readme is not a good representation fo the smoothness.
